# WegWijzer: Erfocentrum Chatbot Prototype

## About This Project

This project was developed as part of the Design Science Project course at the University of Amsterdam (UvA), in collaboration with [Erfocentrum](https://www.erfelijkheid.nl), the Dutch national knowledge centre for hereditary conditions.

### Project Brief

The objective was to improve information findability on the Erfocentrum website for users with low health literacy. Research shows that this user group often struggles with traditional website navigation and search functionality, making it difficult to access relevant health information.

## Solution

We developed **WegWijzer**, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that helps users find information about hereditary conditions by:

- Accepting natural language questions in Dutch
- Retrieving relevant content from the Erfocentrum website
- Presenting condensed, accessible responses with links to source pages

## Prototype Status

This is a test prototype developed for research purposes.

- Built in a standalone HTML environment
- Not integrated into the official Erfocentrum website
- Intended for usability testing and evaluation only

You can test the prototype here: https://elhartw.github.io/DSP-erfo/ 

## Repository Structure

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `sarah.html` | Standalone HTML test environment in which the prototype runs. Deployed via this GitHub repository. |
| `erfocentrum_wegwijzer_v2.ipynb` | Jupyter notebook containing the code for building the chatbot: website scraping, data cleaning, and vector store construction. |
| `app.py` | Chatbot application code including interface layout, system prompt with behavioural constraints, and introductory texts. |
| `requirements.txt` | Python dependencies required to run the chatbot (Gradio, OpenAI, ChromaDB). |

## Setup and Usage

### Chatbot Deployment

The chatbot is deployed on Hugging Face Spaces and embedded into the HTML test environment. Direct access to the Hugging Face Space: [Dsp - Hugging Face Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/elhartw/dsp)

### Data Generation

Running `erfocentrum_wegwijzer_v2.ipynb` generates the JSON file containing the scraped website content used for embeddings. This JSON file is not included in this repository due to file size limitations. However, since the website content is publicly accessible, the data can be regenerated by running the notebook. This is also the procedure for maintaining the chatbot and keeping the information up to date.

### API Key

The code references an OpenAI API secret key. For security reasons, this key is not included in the code but is stored securely in the Hugging Face environment.

## Important Notes

**Inactivity Warning:** After extended periods of inactivity, the Hugging Face Space may be paused. In this case, the prototype will display a blank screen within the chatbot interface. Contact the repository maintainer to reactivate the chatbot.

**API Key Notice:** The OpenAI API key is registered under a personal account and cannot be used by others. Usage of this key incurs costs. If you wish to copy or reuse this chatbot, you will need to create your own API key and bear the associated costs.
