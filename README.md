# WegWijzer: Erfocentrum Chatbot Prototype

## About This Project

This project was developed as part of the Design Science Project course at the University of Amsterdam (UvA), in collaboration with [Erfocentrum](https://www.erfelijkheid.nl), the Dutch national knowledge centre for hereditary conditions.

### Project Brief

The objective was to improve information findability on the Erfocentrum website for users with low health literacy. Research shows that this user group often struggles with traditional website navigation and search functionality, making it difficult to access relevant health information.

## Solution

We developed **WegWijzer**, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that helps users find information about hereditary conditions by:

- Accepting natural language questions in Dutch
- Retrieving relevant content from the Erfocentrum website
- Presenting condensed, accessible responses with links to source pages

## Prototype Status

This is a test prototype developed for research purposes.

- Built in a standalone HTML environment
- Not integrated into the official Erfocentrum website
- Intended for usability testing and evaluation only
